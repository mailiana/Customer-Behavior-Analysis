# Optimizing E-Commerce Inventory Management: A Data-Driven Approach Using Customer Behavior Analysis 

# INTRODUCTION
Background

# Data Cleaning

To ensure accuracy and reliability, the following data cleaning steps were performed:

Finding Duplicates: Removing duplicate entries to reduce errors, prevent data inflation, and avoid bias and noise in the dataset.
Filtering Dataset: Filtering helps to gain more insights into the data. Incomplete rows were removed due to lack of access to complete information. Missing supplier names were labeled as "inhouse supply."
Formatting: Standardizing the format, such as making all text uppercase, to improve readability and ease of use.
